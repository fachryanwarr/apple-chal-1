## 🚀 Overview

Security staff at Green Office Park often face challenges in identifying vehicle owners during parking violations or incidents. Since the parking member data is only accessible through the Secure Parking office, staff are forced to leave their posts, causing delays and inefficiency.

This app streamlines the process by enabling security personnel to scan license plates using a mobile device and instantly retrieve owner information from a local database.

## 🧠 Key Features

- License plate scanning using device camera
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction
- Local database lookup for instant identification
- Minimal and intuitive UI for quick usage in the field
- Offline accessibility to ensure functionality without internet

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** – Declarative UI framework to build a responsive and native interface.
- **AVFoundation** – Used to access the device camera and provide live video feed.
- **Vision Framework** – Handles OCR for detecting and extracting license plate numbers from the camera input.
